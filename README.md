# Udacity (Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree) - Project P1: Movie Trailer Website

Description
The movie trailer website is a movie gallery fully written in Python. The program is composed by three main files:

- movies.py: It's a module that specifies the Movie class.

- fresh_tomatoes.py: This file is composed by a HTML / CSS / JS and some Python code. The Python code receives the movies as a list and interates 
thought the list to dynamically generate the movie gallery.   

- ecenter.py: The file used to add new movies and to run the program. Each movie is declared using a list with the movie's name, plot, poster 
image and trailer (a Youtube URL). It generates a html file with all the movie entries.

Running the program
- Just run the ecenter.py. Open a terminal window and type:

python ecenter.py

- After the this, the program will generate a fresh_tomatoes.html file and will automatically open a browser to show the gallery.

Additional Comments
- Added the movie plot for each entry and changed some CSS (navbar color) in the fresh_tomatoes.py
